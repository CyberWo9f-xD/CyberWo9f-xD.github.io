Want to hear some lo-fi beats, to relax or study to? We've got you covered!

The Lo-Fi Room on TryHackMe is an easy-level challenge focused on Local File Inclusion (LFI). This vulnerability allows an attacker to read files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information. For example, accessing `/etc/passwd` could reveal system user details.

In this walkthrough, we’ll explore the basics of LFI, understand how it works, and exploit it to retrieve important files. Let’s dive in and start solving the room!

### Intelligence Gathering
First, we analyzed the room description and discovered some valuable hints. These clues provided insights into potential vulnerabilities and guided our approach to exploiting the Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw. By carefully examining the information given, i was able to identify key entry points for further investigation.

Now, i begin with an Nmap scan to identify open ports and running services on the target machine. This step helps me understand the attack surface and determine potential entry points for exploitation. Let’s run the scan and analyze the results!

### Nmap Scan

From our Nmap scan, we discovered that two ports are open:
- Port 22 – Running SSH, which could be useful for remote access if i find valid credentials.
- Port 80 – Hosting a web server, making it our primary target for further investigation.

Since the challenge revolves around Local File Inclusion (LFI), i’ll focus on exploring the web application.

Everything seemed normal at first, but upon exploring the Discography section, i clicked on "Relax" and noticed something interesting. The URL contained a page parameter, formatted as: `http://lo-fi.thm/?page=relax.php`
![image description](Assets/Pictures/Lo-Fi/page-parameter.png)

When i replaced relax.php with /etc/passwd in the page parameter: `http://lo-fi.thm/?page=/etc/passwd`
Instead of displaying the file contents, i met with a warning message:

- HACKKERRR!! HACKER DETECTED. STOP HACKING YOU STINKIN HACKER!

![image description](Assets/Pictures/Lo-Fi/warn-message.png)

This response indicates that the server has some basic detection mechanisms in place, but it doesn’t appear to be properly filtering Local File Inclusion (LFI) attempts. Instead of blocking LFI outright, it's likely checking for direct access to system files.
To bypass this restriction, we need to perform directory traversal using techniques like `../../../../etc/passwd` to navigate through the file system and retrieve the target files.

To perform directory traversal, i will use fuzzing techniques to identify potential bypasses. Specifically, i’ll leverage FFUF (Fast File Fuzzer) along with LFI wordlists to automate testing various traversal payloads.
- By crafting payloads like: `http://lo-fi.thm/?page=FUZZ`

### Fuzzing
````bash
┌──(Cyb3rWo9f㉿v0ids3ek3r)-[/TryHackMe/Lo-Fi]
└─$ ffuf -w "/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt" -u "http://lo-fi.thm/?page=FUZZ" -fl 124

../../../etc/passwd     [Status: 200, Size: 4638, Words: 1363, Lines: 143, Duration: 185ms]
../../../../etc/passwd  [Status: 200, Size: 4638, Words: 1363, Lines: 143, Duration: 185ms]
````

Now, i will attempt to access `/etc/passwd` by replacing the page parameter with result payloads.

i successfully bypassed the restrictions and gained access to the `/etc/passwd` file.
 - This confirms that the application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI), allowing us to read sensitive system files.

### Flag
![image description](Assets/Pictures/Lo-Fi/flag.txt.png)
By replacing `/etc/passwd` with `flag.txt` in the page parameter
we successfully accessed the flag and completed the `Lo-Fi` room!
