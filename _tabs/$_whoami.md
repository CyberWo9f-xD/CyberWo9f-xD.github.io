### **Hello Friend !**

`Cyb3rWo9f` (pronounced **/ˈsaɪbər ˈwʊlf/**). Also known as `v0ids3ek3r`, Just another curious mind passionate about chess, Linux (KDE gang), and everything related to computer systems—programming, networking, security, and eventually, hacking. Over time, I’ve become less talkative about myself, but you now know my favorite topics. My DMs are open, so feel free to hit me up if you’ve got any questions.
